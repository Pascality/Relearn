#  Relearned stuff lets goo.

I just relearned push and pull.
origin is justa  variable typa used to refer to the remote repo.
-u helps is create shortcuts for future pushes
when you clone you dont need to do certain steps like git remote add origin < link >.
When you just inittialize (init) files into a repo we need to remote add.
